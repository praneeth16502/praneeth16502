## 🚀 What I Build

- 🧩 End-to-end products — frontend, backend, APIs, and infra
- ⚙️ Backend and platform systems that scale and stay debuggable
- 🧠 AI-powered features (LLMs, RAG, agents) grounded in real workflows
- 📊 User-facing interfaces that prioritize clarity, performance, and trust

> I enjoy taking ambiguous ideas from a whiteboard to production.
